/*:
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall. 
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image: 
 
 ![undertones-no-grid](undertones-no-grid.png "Undertones")
 ![undertones-with-grid](undertones-with-grid.png "Undertones")

 By precisely reproducing this image, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
 
 * sequence (order of statements in a program)
 * conditionals (making decisions with ``if`` statements)
 * iteration (use of loops to repeat statements)
 
 You may use the color constants created below to obtain the correct colors.
 
 Remember that you can refer to the [Canvas class documentation](https://www.russellgordon.ca/canvasgraphics/documentation/classes/canvas), as needed.

// Create a new canvas

// COLORS
let lightGrey = Color(hue: 84, saturation: 6, brightness: 88, alpha: 100)
let deepRed = Color(hue: 7, saturation: 97, brightness: 72, alpha: 100)

let black = Color(hue: 0, saturation: 0, brightness: 0, alpha: 100)


// Begin your solution here...


//Create the background

canvas.fillColor = lightGrey

canvas.drawRectangle(at: Point(x: 0, y: 0), width: 400, height: 600)


//Making the word undertone

// I can see that the undertones is half between 0 and 50 so its 30


//I don't think you can rotate the other way
//This is wrong


//canvas.translate(to: Point(x: 25, y: 380))
//canvas.drawAxes()

// Undertones text
//canvas.drawText(message: "undertones", at: Point(x: 0, y: 0), size: 64, kerning: 0.0)


//for _ in 1...19 {
    
//Rotate origin
//canvas.rotate(by: 2)

//canvas.drawText(message: "undertones", at: Point(x: 0, y: 0), size: 65, kerning: 0.0)



//Draw horizontal lines in grid

//for x in stride(from: 0, through: 400, by: 50) {
    
//canvas.drawLine(from: Point(x: x, y: 0), to: Point(x: x, y: 600))
    


//The small texts (understanding that this goes first (sequence) since it has not been rotated yet

canvas.textColor = deepRed

canvas.drawText(message: "straight music presents ", at: Point(x: 25, y: 550), size: 13, kerning: 0.0)


canvas.translate(to: Point(x: -11 , y: 370))

//Rotate origin
canvas.rotate(by: -90)


for _ in 1...19 {
//canvas.drawAxes()

    
canvas.textColor = black
    
//Undertones text
canvas.drawText(message: "undertones", at: Point(x: 0, y: 0), size: 64, kerning: 0.0)

    canvas.rotate(by: 5)
}
    
//The color logic

//Every time it runs, the color gets lighter, this has something to with the 1...19 for in loop
